## This upstart job installs packages needed for QR-Linux bsp support into the
## Linaro Ubuntu root filesystem
## It also does ifup eth0. We don't want eth0 to be automatically brought
## up from /etc/network/interfaces, so we do it from here.
##
## This file is manually copied into the stock Linaro Ubuntu
## filesystem and a new userdata image created out of it
