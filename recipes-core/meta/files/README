What is the SDK:
---------------
This SDK is cross-development toolkit for the apps processor in the Snapdragon SOC. Once installed, it provides:
   - The gcc cross toolchain, which is downloaded from the Linaro servers
   - The include files and libraries needed to compile and link user space applications
     that will run on the apps processor
   - The environment setup script environment-setup-<target> needed by the
     cross toolchain

How do I install the SDK:
------------------------
To install the SDK:
   - Locate the tarball containing the SDK (of which this file is a part). In the build tree it's located at
     build/tmp-eglibc/deploy/sdk
   - Untar the file in the desired location
   - Run the installer from the untarred files

E.g. to install the tarball at /path/to/qrlSDK.tgz at location /dir/to/install/sdk
> ls /path/to/qrlSDK.tgz
qrlSDK.tgz
> ls /dir/to/install/sdk
ls: cannot access /dir/to/install/sdk: No such file or directory
> mkdir -p /dir/to/extract/sdk
> tar zxf /path/to/qrlSDK.tgz -C /dir/to/extract/sdk
> /dir/to/extract/sdk/qrlSDKInstaller.sh -s /dir/to/extract/sdk -d /dir/to/install/sdk

How to compile and run the sample app:
-------------------------------------
A sample app is included in the SDK tarball. To compile the included sample app:
> cd /dir/to/extract/sdk/sample
> source /dir/to/install/sdk/environment-setup-cortexa8hf-vfp-neon-linux-gnueabi
> make
You can now use "adb push" to push the app to target and run it.

What does the environment setup actually do:
-------------------------------------------
The environment setup sets environemnt variables like CC, CFLAGS, LDFLAGS etc.
such that you can source this file, and then use a Makefile to build. The
environment variables provide $CC, $CFLAGS, etc. variables to the Makefile, 
making it simple to compile/link your code. The environment setup also includes 
passing --sysroot=xxx to gcc, such that include file and libraries used on the
target can be linked with your code.

How to choose the gcc version:
------------------------------
The environment-setup-cortexa8hf-vfp-neon-linux-gnueabi takes as argument the
gcc version to be used. It supports gcc4.8 and gcc4.9 only, and gcc4.8 is the 
default.

E.g to use environment-setup-cortexa8hf-vfp-neon-linux-gnueabi
> source environment-setup-cortexa8hf-vfp-neon-linux-gnueabi -h
                                                            ^^^^
[INFO] environment-setup-cortexa8hf-vfp-neon-linux-gnueabi takes one optional 
argument, the desired gcc version. You can specify either "gcc4.8" (default) 
or "gcc4.9"

E.g. to use gcc 4.8
> source environment-setup-cortexa8hf-vfp-neon-linux-gnueabi
or
> source environment-setup-cortexa8hf-vfp-neon-linux-gnueabi gcc4.8

E.g. to use gcc 4.9
> source environment-setup-cortexa8hf-vfp-neon-linux-gnueabi gcc4.9
